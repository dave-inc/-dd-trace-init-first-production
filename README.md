A package that initializes dd trace when the environment is production, (and is
lexographically superior, so that it is sorted to be "first").

Yes, I realize that someone else could do a similar trick to beat this. The goal
isn't to be the absolute first, but to be first enough that it's probably not
accidental if someone is more first.

# Usage
To use this package, import or require it.
